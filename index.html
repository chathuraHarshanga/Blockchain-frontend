                BeefLedger is an integrated provenance, blockchain security and payments platform. It is a general purpose technology platform project, utilising blockchain technologies, that seeks to harness a diverse range of product provenance information as a basis of improved payments and confidence amongst supply chain participants.
                
                It will provide a platform by which consumers can validate the credentials of the product they are purchasing, and drive efficiencies in the supply chain by reducing information asymmetries between transacting parties. BeefLedger combines the blockchain’s attribute of being a robust validator of historic states (as a record of past events) and the power of crypto-economics to drive incentivised systems shaping behavioural optimisation in supply chains.

                As demand for beef in growing markets like China grows, the risks of meat fraud and safety increases. A robust credentialing platform is needed to ensure the reputation and value of the Australian beef industry is protected. BeefLedger can monetise data value, and ensure this value is captured by those responsible for its production. This includes provenance data right through to consumer data. Whereas Australians consume on average 26kg per person of beef per year, Chinese consumption is at considerably lower levels (6kg). However, Chinese beef consumption is growing rapidly.

                Our mission is driven out of the experiences of our team, which has extensive (decades’ long) involvement in beef production and distribution, land management, product packaging innovation, financial services and cross-border trade – particularly with China. The team straddles extensive industry experience and expertise, combined with a strong research and development core backed by our academic institutional partnerships and allied industry partners.
